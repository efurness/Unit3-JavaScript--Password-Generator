# Unit3-JavaScript--Password-Generator 3-12-2022

### Description 

This project involved making a random password generator using Javascript.  There are a lot of ways of completing this assignment and it's important to review these and then decide on the structure you want to start with that includes initiating the variables and complete functions for each set of characters, from symbols to letters.  For the user it is important to establish the length the password and then ask them the type of characters they want, either lower case or upper case letters or symbols or numbers.  In addition, have conditional statements to guide the user along the way with window dialog prompts, alerts and confirm statements.  Alerts can be used here to let the user know they entered the wrong value outside the parameters of the length of the password, in this example, less than 8 or over 128 characters. Window method confirms are just to verify what the user wants, usually true or false and click OK.  If cancel button is clicked it will return null.  Prompt windows just notifies user to proceed.
